    description: With AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway, we have the possibility to create serverless web-applications that can scale to whatever size we need. By going serverless, we take away all the management tasks that are involved in keeping a web-application up and running. During this workshop we'll build a Node.js web-application based on Claudia.js, which will run without a server. As the most interesting part is concerning the backend, we'll only have a very small and simple client.
    skill: "TBA"
    prerequisites: Have an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account. Have a properly set up Node.js environment.

    description: We live in a component-based world. And complex components are based on simple once. This implies the need to express dependencies between them. Most existing methods have notable disadvantages, hardcode, refactoring complexity, large amount of manual work and so on. And there's a way to get rid of all these issues.

    description: Developers tend to believe that you have to be born with some kind of superhuman artistic gene that will magically make you a great designer, but this is not true. Design is a skill, and as a skill it can be taught.
